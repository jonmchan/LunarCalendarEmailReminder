# Lunar Calendar Email Reminder

This application is a simple set and forget email reminder tool that will send an email out to remind you of an event in the lunar calendar. It is useful for getting reminders for Asian parents or grandparents that celebrate their birthday in the lunar calendar or to remind you of any other lunar calendar events. You can also use this to find out your lunar birthday by entering in your western birthday with the year.

I could not find this functionality in google calendar so I wrote this application very quickly to fill in this gap. This application will work until 2050 and then it will stop working because of a limitation in the lunar conversion library I am using. Hopefully I will update it before then!

## Known Issues:

* If you sign in with Multiple Sign On with google, you may get a 500 error. Use a Google Chrome incognito session or sign out of all your other email accounts as a workaround for now. If I find a solution, I'll fix it.
